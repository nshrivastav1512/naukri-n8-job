# Naukri.com Job Search & Resume Tailoring Automaton üöÄ

## Overview

This project automates the tedious process of searching for relevant jobs on **Naukri.com**, analyzing their requirements against your resume, tailoring your resume specifically for high-match positions, and evaluating the effectiveness of the tailoring. It aims to streamline the job application workflow, save time, and increase the chances of landing interviews by submitting highly relevant resumes.

The core workflow involves:
1.  Scraping job listings from **Naukri.com** based on your search criteria.
2.  Extracting detailed information from each job posting.
3.  Utilizing Google's Gemini AI to analyze the job description, compare it against your **base resume**, and generate a match score.
4.  For jobs exceeding a defined match score threshold, automatically tailoring your base HTML resume using AI suggestions.
5.  Generating both HTML and PDF versions of the tailored resumes.
6.  Optionally **rescoring the tailored resume** against the job description using AI to assess the effectiveness of the tailoring.
7.  Storing all collected data, analysis results, tailoring status, and file paths in a central Excel file for review and further action.

**Disclaimer:** Web scraping, especially on dynamic sites like Naukri.com, can be fragile. Naukri's website structure changes frequently, which may break the scraping components (Phases 1 & 2) of this tool. The CSS selectors defined in the configuration may need regular updates. Use this tool responsibly and ethically, respecting Naukri.com's Terms of Service. Automation should augment, not replace, genuine engagement.

## Project Workflow / Phases üìù

The automation process is divided into distinct phases, orchestrated by `main_workflow_naukri.py`:

**Phase 0: Configuration & Setup (`main_workflow_naukri.py`)**
*   Loads all configuration settings from the script itself and the `naukri_search_config.json` file.
*   Initializes logging to console and a file in the `logs_naukri/` directory.
*   Checks accessibility of the main Excel file (`naukri_jobs_master_list.xlsx`).
*   Loads environment variables (e.g., API key) from the `.env` file.
*   Calls the functions for the subsequent phases based on the `start_phase` and `end_phase` configuration.

**Phase 1: Scrape Job List (`phase1_list_scraper_naukri.py`)**
*   Connects to an existing Chrome instance running with remote debugging enabled.
*   Builds a search URL for Naukri.com using the keywords, location, and filters defined in `naukri_search_config.json`.
*   Navigates to the search results page.
*   Scrapes basic information (Title, Company, Location, Link, Job ID, etc.) from job cards.
*   Handles pagination by clicking the "Next" button.
*   Adds newly found, unique jobs to the master Excel file (`naukri_jobs_master_list.xlsx`) with an initial `Status` of `New`.

**Phase 2: Scrape Job Details (`phase2_detail_scraper_naukri.py`)**
*   Connects to the Chrome instance.
*   Reads the master Excel file.
*   Filters for jobs with `Status` = `New` (or specific error statuses if retry is enabled).
*   For each eligible job, navigates to its specific Naukri.com job `Link`.
*   Scrapes detailed information, including the full job description, salary, role details, and company information.
*   Updates the corresponding row in the Excel file with the scraped details and sets the `Status` to `Ready for AI`.

**Phase 3: AI Analysis & Scoring (`phase3_ai_analysis.py`)**
*   This phase is job-board agnostic. It reads job data from the Excel file (scraped in Phase 2).
*   It sends the job description and your base resume text to the Gemini AI for analysis, scoring, and extraction of key details.
*   Updates the Excel file with the AI's analysis and sets the `Status` to `AI Analyzed`.

**Phase 4: AI Resume Tailoring & PDF Generation (`phase4_tailoring.py`)**
*   This phase is also job-board agnostic.
*   It filters for jobs that meet a minimum AI score threshold.
*   For each eligible job, it sends a detailed prompt to the Gemini AI to generate tailored content for your resume.
*   It applies these suggestions to the `Resume.html` template and saves the output as new HTML and PDF files in the `Tailored_Resumes_Naukri/` folder.

**Phase 5: Rescore Tailored Resumes (`phase5_rescore.py`)**
*   This final phase is also job-board agnostic.
*   It takes the newly tailored resume, re-scores it against the job description using the same AI process from Phase 3.
*   It updates the Excel file with the new score, allowing you to track the effectiveness of the resume tailoring.
